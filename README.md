I needed something to feed three audio sources into my amplifier's AUX input. I also wanted to learn how to design a simple schematic and PCB with Eagle. As a power source I wanted to be able to use any USB port, so the power supply schematic turned out more complex than the actual thing.

Anyways, that's it.

Careful, the PCB is out of date at the moment! Below is what it once looked like.
